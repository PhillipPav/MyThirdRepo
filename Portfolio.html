                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>   
                <p> I began my studies at the University of Tasmania studying a Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology majoring in Games and Creative Technology. I have since transferred and continue my ICT studies at Deakin University majoring in Application Development.
                    My studies in ICT have allowed me to further develop my skills in software development, game design. I am keen to become part of a team in the ICT industry and am working towards building a diversified project portfolio to show my curiosity and abilities in ICT. </p>
